--list of op-codes and their description:


NOP_ - no operation / no data. Used inside the optimizer as a temporary placeholder. 
PU1_ - push one register to stack
PU2_ - push two registers to stack (First_Reg is pushed first)
PUA1 - push one register to stack for argument to a function
PUA2 - push two registers to stack for argument to a function (First_Reg is pushed first)
POP1 - pop one register to stack
POP2 - pop two registers to stack (First_Reg is popped to first)
BL1_ - lower byte load to register
RL1_ - load word to register
RL2_ - load double word to two registers, Second_Reg gets upper word
CALL - call to location at registers, Second_Reg is upper word. (see CALL/RET_ description at bottom)
RET_ - return to calling function  (see CALL/RET_ description at bottom)
STPA - transform stack offset into real address using [ %1 + ( Stack_Size - # ) -> First_Reg ]
			this instruction, when combined with others, may often by optimized into STWN , STRN , STWV , STRV
STPS - identical to STPA, however it is verified that ( ( Stack_Size - # ) <= 0x00FF ) is true, so the backend can use 1 less instruction (and ~2x less cycles)

STWN - write memory ( word access, non-volatile ) at [ ( %1 + ( 2 * $ ) ) , 0 ] with data in First_Reg
STRN - read  memory ( word access, non-volatile ) at [ ( %1 + ( 2 * $ ) ) , 0 ] into First_Reg
STWV - write memory ( word access, volatile     ) at [ ( %1 + ( 2 * $ ) ) , 0 ] with data in First_Reg
STRV - read  memory ( word access, volatile     ) at [ ( %1 + ( 2 * $ ) ) , 0 ] into First_Reg

ALOC - move stack pointer using [ Stack_Pointer - ( Stack_Size - Initial_Stack_Size ) -> Stack_Pointer ] then [ Stack_Pointer -> %1 ]  (used when function starts, Stack_Size and Initial_Stack_Size value is held in the InstructionBuffer)
ALCR - move stack pointer using [ # -> First_Reg ] then [ Stack_Pointer - First_Reg -> Stack_Pointer ] then [ Stack_Pointer -> First_Reg ]  (used when allocating space for return value for a CALL)
STOF - get stack with offset using [ Stack_Pointer -> Second_Reg ] then [ # -> First_Reg ] then [ First_Reg + Second_Reg -> First_Reg ]  (used when getting return value for a CALL, in which case First_Reg is the desired output)
		Note that in initial compiler output (do not rely on it), ALCR and STOF would probably be enclosing the parameters that go to the function call
		however, primarily because not every function returns non-void, not every function call has a ALCR and STOF pair
		also, STOF can be optimized out if the First_Reg from ALCR can be kept in a register while the arguments are being pushed
		also, ALCR (and possibly STOF) can be optimized out if there is a way to calculate an address on stack to where the return value could go to avoid it getting stack space allocated by ALCR


AJMP - always absolute jump to address in registers, Second_Reg is upper word
CJMP - conditionally jump to address in first and second registers if third register is zero, Second_Reg is upper word of address

JJMP - always absolute jump to address in registers, Second_Reg is upper word. This jump is for jump tables.
		It also acts as a LABL instruction for it's label number, which points to the 'instruction' after this one.
		Instruction slots after this one (until a JEND) will be JTEN 'instructions' (it is data, and should not be executed, so they are not actually instructions)
JTEN - inserts the location of the label at this location (as a dword) for a jump table. Must be between JJMP and JEND
JEND - see JJMP. This 'instruction' does not translate to an instruction on the backend.

MOV_ - move word in Second_Reg to First_Reg

AND_ - bitwise and  of second and third register into first register
OR__ - bitwise  or  of second and third register into first register
XOR_ - bitwise xor  of second and third register into first register
SSUB - do First_Reg+Second_Reg+~Third_Reg -> Second_Reg, with carry stored to ones bit of First_Reg 
		In general, carry should not extend past ones bit.
		If the sum would have a carry greater then 1, First_Reg will still get 1.
		First_Reg (as the input) is intended to only hold a value of 0 or 1, but could hold other values.
		Note: the '~' is a bitwise invert on Third_Reg
ADDN - add      second and third register into first register
ADDC - add      second and third register into first register, and place carry into ones bit in %F (all other bits get 0)
SUBN - subtract second and third register into first register
SUBC - subtract second and third register then place carry into ones bit in first register (all other bits get 0)

MULS - multiply first and second register then place result into first register (upper word is not generated)
MULL - multiply double word of [%E,%F] and double word of [First_Reg,Second_Reg] then place result into double word of [%E,%F]
DIVM - do first register divided by second register, as well as first register modulus second register, then place results into first and second register (first gets division, second gets modulus)

SHFT - shift bits in second register down (to lower bits) by 1 bit, then store into first register (second register is not modified, the most significant bit of first register will be 0)
BSWP - take word in second register, swap the byte order, then place result into first register (second register is not modified)

MWWN - memory write word non-volatile - read  word   at [Second_Reg,Third_Reg] and place in First_Reg
MRWN - memory read  word non-volatile - write word into [Second_Reg,Third_Reg] with word in First_Reg
MWWV - memory write word volatile     - read  word   at [Second_Reg,Third_Reg] and place in First_Reg
MRWV - memory read  word volatile     - write word into [Second_Reg,Third_Reg] with word in First_Reg
MWBN - memory write byte non-volatile - read  byte   at [%E,Second_Reg] and place in lower byte of First_Reg
MRBN - memory read  byte non-volatile - write byte into [%E,Second_Reg] with byte in lower byte of First_Reg
MWBV - memory write byte volatile     - read  byte   at [%E,Second_Reg] and place in lower byte of First_Reg
MRBV - memory read  byte volatile     - write byte into [%E,Second_Reg] with byte in lower byte of First_Reg

LABL - marks a location. It points to whatever instruction is directly after it. This 'instruction' does not translate to an instruction on the backend.

D32U - performs a 32 bit division operation for unsigned inputs. 
		it expects the inputs to be:
			left_lower  -> %2
			left_upper  -> %3
			right_lower -> %4
			right_lower -> %5
			
			all other registers are ignored
			
		outputs division result to:
			out_lower -> %8
			out_upper -> %9
			
			all other registers are assumed to hold indeterminate values when this instruction completes
			
		internally, this pushes a zero to the stack, 
		then it will load the address of label 00000001,
		then CALL to the address

R32U - performs a 32 bit remainder operation for unsigned inputs. 
		it expects the inputs to be:
			left_lower  -> %2
			left_upper  -> %3
			right_lower -> %4
			right_lower -> %5
			
			all other registers are ignored
			
		outputs division result to:
			out_lower -> %6
			out_upper -> %7
			
			all other registers are assumed to hold indeterminate values when this instruction completes
			
		internally, this pushes a zero to the stack, 
		then it will load the address of label 00000002,
		then CALL to the address

D32S - performs a 32 bit division operation for signed inputs. 
		it expects the inputs to be:
			left_lower  -> %2
			left_upper  -> %3
			right_lower -> %4
			right_lower -> %5
			
			all other registers are ignored
			
		outputs division result to:
			out_lower -> %8
			out_upper -> %9
			
			all other registers are assumed to hold indeterminate values when this instruction completes
			
		internally, this pushes a zero to the stack, 
		then it will load the address of label 00000003,
		then CALL to the address


R32S - performs a 32 bit remainder operation for signed inputs. 
		it expects the inputs to be:
			left_lower  -> %2
			left_upper  -> %3

			right_lower -> %5
			
			all other registers are ignored
			
		outputs division result to:
			out_lower -> %6
			out_upper -> %7
			
			all other registers are assumed to hold indeterminate values when this instruction completes
			
		internally, this pushes a zero to the stack, 
		then it will load the address of label 00000004,
		then CALL to the address


FCST - indicates the start of a function is next. also acts as a LABL instruction.
		The word attached is the Stack_Size
		The byte attached is the Initial_Stack_Size
		This 'instruction' does not translate to an instruction on the backend.
FCEN - indicates the end of a function is here (the instruction above is the last instruction to be considered included in the function most recently indicated)
		FCST and FCEN may NOT be nested
		This 'instruction' does not translate to an instruction on the backend.

-- Using CALL/RET_ :

There are some technicalities which make things a little complicated, but easier.

The register %0 is used as a reference point for function calls and returns. 
The register %1 is used as a reference point for the stack frame.
	Generally, %0 and %1 should not be modified by other instructions, however it can be, so be careful.
	ALOC is intended to use these registers, and should always be run at the start of every function.


--Using CALL :

All function calls push arguments last to first, and they use the PUA1 or PUA2 instructions instead of the normal PU1_ and PU2_ instructions

As always, values with more then one word are pushed as the upper word first, for a little endian representation.

First, if and only if the function does not return void, extend stack for return value by ALCR

Then, push arguments.

Then, if applicable, the location of label of function is put into registers (by default, %A and %B).
If the function is being used as a pointer to function, then the location is put into registers from some other operation.

If and only if the function does not return void, an extra argument gets pushed ( by PUA1 ) after all other arguments so far mentioned, and this argument's size is included in Arg_Size
  this possible extra argument contains the address on stack (which if interpreted as a memory address would be the same except that the upper word is zero) that the return value is to be written to

The sizes of all arguments (size is calculated as size on stack) must be calculated from the actual arguments being pushed and then manually pushed by PUA1 after all other arguments so far mentioned.
	The size is in number of bytes, but should always be word alliged. This size is known as Arg_Size, and is not included in Arg_Size.

Then the instruction CALL is done, with it's registers being the location of the function in memory. This transfers control over to the function, which will return to the next instruction when it is completed

When the function returns to the next instruction, all of the arguments to the function have already been popped off the stack, and %0 and %1 holds the same value as it did before CALL



--Internal information for CALL:

When CALL is executed, 
	it pushes %0 to the stack, 
	then pushes %1 to the stack,
	then pushes the double word of the address the instruction counter should return to on function return. 
		The upper word is pushed first.

Then the Stack_Pointer (which is pointing to the lower word of the return address) is put into %0

Then the instrution counter is set to the value in the argument registers.



--Using RET_ :

using RET_ is quite easy. Just don't modify %0 or %1 anywhere in the program.

when the current function desires to return to it's caller, it may use the RET_ instruction. The next instruction is never executed (unless it gets jumped to, of course). The Stack_Pointer may have any value, so it doesn't matter if push/pop pairs are balanced or not.


--Internal information for RET_:

When RET_ is executed, it sets Stack_Pointer to %0.

Then, it pops the next two words into the instruction pointer ( first pop is the lower word ).

Then, it pops the next word into %1.

Then, it pops the next word into %0.

Then, it pops the next word into a temporary storage that will be called TempReg1

Then, it does [ Stack_Pointer + TempReg1 -> Stack_Pointer ]
